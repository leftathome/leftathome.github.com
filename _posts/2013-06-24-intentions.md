I've been contributing scattershot to open source projects, particularly ones focused on server automation,
monitoring and orchestration, for about ten years now.  Seemed to me like it might be a good idea to start
collecting my ideas in one place rather than spread them over a bunch of mailing lists.  Especially since
presenting at ChefConf this year...

The opinions and ideas I express here are my own and in no way reflect the opinions or ideas of any of my
past, present or future employers.
